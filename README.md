|2024|SQL|Independent Study Assignment| SQL Foundation|**Start-Up Campus** :<br> <br> Processed the dataset obtained from Bigquery Public Dataset: theLook eCommerce with SQL and found 10 insights from the dataset that are useful for business. <br> <br> Link : https://github.com/rahelcecilia/SQL-Foundation-Studi-Independent|
|2023|Machine Learning|College Assignment| Classification Using Apache Spark| **Classification Using Apache Spark** : <br> <br> This project is an assignment for the Big Data course at the Informatics Engineering department of Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology. The datasets used are Diabetes Dataset. Diabetes dataset is a collection of medical and demographic data from patients, along with their diabetes status (positive or negative). The data includes features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. This can be useful for healthcare professionals in identifying patients who may be at risk of developing diabetes and in developing personalized treatment plans. <br>  This project goes through several stages such as: data engineering, data cleansing, model development, model evaluation, and summary. <br> <br> **Machine Learning algorithms used**: <br> 1. Decision Tree (PySpark) <br> 2. Random Forest(PySpark) <br> <br> Link : https://github.com/rahelcecilia/Classification-Using-Apache-Spark |
|2023|Website|College Assignment| Maritime Museum Tour Website | **Maritime Museum Tour Website** : <br><br> This is the final project of the Technology-Based Entrepreneurship course which raises the topic of creating a website as a means of maritime tourism in Surabaya, Indonesia. I am an IT support who doubles as Front-End and Backend-End. <br><br> Link : https://rahelcecilia.purba.or.id/MMT/|
|2023|Machine Learning|Competition|Data Prediction Data Analysis Competition 2023| **DAC 2023** :<br> <br> Participate in the Data Analytic Competition 2023 by the Statistics Association of the Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology (HIMASTA-ITS) at Statistic Fair 2023. Participants were given a problem to predict multiple classes. <br> <br> Link : https://github.com/rahelcecilia/Data-Analysis-Competition-DAC-2023|
|2023|Website|Internship|Universiti Sains Malaysia Website|**Universiti Sains Malaysia Website** :<br> <br> This project was created as a fulfillment of my internship project at Universiti Sains Malaysia at the School of Computer Science on April 26 2023 â€“ August 31 2023 with the jobdesk **Developing websites for research groups**. The website must contain information such as the background of the research group, projects that have been involved, publications, etc. <br><br> **Website Features** :<br> 1. A website with 2 types of accounts, Admin and Students. <br> 2. Login & registration, CRUD features (Create, Read, Update, delete), upload an image feature, feature search.<br> 3.CRUD and upload for admin, search for students. <br><br> Link : https://rahelcecilia.purba.or.id/USM/|
|2022|Website| College Assignment | Recifood Website | **Web Programming Course** : <br> <br> we are assigned to create a website that can be used by many people. So, my team decided to create a ReciFood website. ReciFood is a place for those who love agriculture, various types of food and cooking. At ReciFood there are many explanations about food ingredients, how to cook food, and other interesting information. I served as a Back-End Developer which created a database containing news, categories, and logged in users and created a search feature. <br> <br> Link : http://rahelcecilia.purba.or.id/recipe |
|2022|SQL| Dummy Project | Build a Student Database | **Playing with SQL** : <br> <br> Practice using SQL with public datasets and try to gain insight. <br> <br> Link : https://github.com/rahelcecilia/build-a-student-database|
|2022|SQL| Bootcamp | The Fundamentals of Data Analytics |**Bootcamp**  : <br> <br> In September 2022, I took part in "The Fundamentals of Data Analytics" Bootcamp Training. I got my final assignment, which was to process some raw data and then apply what I learned during the bootcamp.This final project uses SQL to process the dataset. <br> <br> Link : https://github.com/rahelcecilia/Analisis-Data|
